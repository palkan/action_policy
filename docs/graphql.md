# GraphQL integration

You can use Action Policy as an authorization library for your [GraphQL Ruby](https://graphql-ruby.org/) application via the [`action_policy-graphql` gem](https://github.com/palkan/action_policy-graphql).

This integration provides the following features:
- Fields & mutations authorization
- List and connections scoping
- [**Exposing permissions/authorization rules in the API**](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/exposing-permissions-in-graphql-apis-with-action-policy).

## Getting Started

First, add the `action_policy-graphql` gem to your Gemfile (see [installation instructions](https://github.com/palkan/action_policy-graphql#installation)).

Then, include `ActionPolicy::GraphQL::Behaviour` to your base type (or any other type/mutation where you want to use authorization features):

```ruby
# For fields authorization, lists scoping and rules exposing
class Types::BaseObject < GraphQL::Schema::Object
  include ActionPolicy::GraphQL::Behaviour
end

# For using authorization helpers in mutations
class Types::BaseMutation < GraphQL::Schema::Mutation
  include ActionPolicy::GraphQL::Behaviour
end

# For using authorization helpers in resolvers
class Types::BaseResolver < GraphQL::Schema::Resolver
  include ActionPolicy::GraphQL::Behaviour
end
```

## Authorization Context

By default, Action Policy uses `context[:current_user]` as the `user` [authorization context](./authorization_context.md).

**NOTE:** see below for more information on what's included into `ActionPolicy::GraphQL::Behaviour`.

## Authorizing Fields

You can add `authorize: true` option to any field (=underlying object) to protect the access (it's equal to calling `authorize! object, to: :show?`):

```ruby
# authorization could be useful for find-like methods,
# where the object is resolved from the provided params (e.g., ID)
field :home, Home, null: false, authorize: true do
  argument :id, ID, required: true
end

def home(id:)
  Home.find(id)
end

# Without `authorize: true` the code would look like this
def home(id:)
  Home.find(id).tap { |home| authorize! home, to: :show? }
end
```

You can use authorization options to customize the behaviour, e.g. `authorize: {to: :preview?, with: CustomPolicy}`.

By default, if a user is not authorized to access the field, an `ActionPolicy::Unauthorized` exception is raised.

If you want to return a `nil` instead, you should add `raise: false` to the options:

```ruby
# NOTE: don't forget to mark your field as nullable
field :home, Home, null: true, authorize: {raise: false}
```

You can make non-raising behaviour a default by setting a configuration option:

```ruby
ActionPolicy::GraphQL.authorize_raise_exception = false
```

You can also change the default `show?` rule globally:

```ruby
ActionPolicy::GraphQL.default_authorize_rule = :show_graphql_field?
```

If you want to perform authorization before resolving the field value, you can use `preauthorize: *` option:

```ruby
field :homes, [Home], null: false, preauthorize: {with: HomePolicy}

def homes
  Home.all
end
```

The code above is equal to:

```ruby
field :homes, [Home], null: false

def homes
  authorize! "homes", to: :index?, with: HomePolicy
  Home.all
end
```

**NOTE:** we pass the field's name as the `record` to the policy rule. We assume that preauthorization rules do not depend on
the record itself and pass the field's name for debugging purposes only.

You can customize the authorization options, e.g. `authorize: {to: :preview?, with: CustomPolicy}`.

**NOTE:** unlike `authorize: *` you MUST specify the `with: SomePolicy` option.
The default authorization rule depends on the type of the field:

- for lists we use `index?` (configured by `ActionPolicy::GraphQL.default_preauthorize_list_rule` parameter)
- for _singleton_ fields we use `show?` (configured by `ActionPolicy::GraphQL.default_preauthorize_node_rule` parameter)

### Class-level authorization

You can use Action Policy in the class-level [authorization hooks](https://graphql-ruby.org/authorization/authorization.html) (`self.authorized?`) like this:

```ruby
class Types::Friendship < Types::BaseObject
  def self.authorized?(object, context)
    super &&
      allowed_to?(
        :show?,
        object,
        # NOTE: you must provide context explicitly
        context: {user: context[:current_user]}
      )
  end
end
```

## Authorizing Mutations

A mutation is just a Ruby class with a single API method. There is nothing specific in authorizing mutations: from the Action Policy point of view, they are just [_behaviours_](./behaviour.md).

If you want to authorize the mutation, you call `authorize!` method. For example:

```ruby
class Mutations::DestroyUser < Types::BaseMutation
  argument :id, ID, required: true

  def resolve(id:)
    user = User.find(id)

    # Raise an exception if the user has not enough permissions
    authorize! user, to: :destroy?
    # Or check without raising and do what you want
    #
    #     if allowed_to?(:destroy?, user)

    user.destroy!

    {deleted_id: user.id}
  end
end
```

## Handling exceptions

The query would fail with `ActionPolicy::Unauthorized` exception when using `authorize: true` (in raising mode) or calling `authorize!` explicitly.

That could be useful to handle this exception and send a more detailed error message to the client, for example:

```ruby
# in your schema file
rescue_from(ActionPolicy::Unauthorized) do |exp|
  raise GraphQL::ExecutionError.new(
    # use result.message (backed by i18n) as an error message
    exp.result.message,
    # use GraphQL error extensions to provide more context
    extensions: {
      code: :unauthorized,
      fullMessages: exp.result.reasons.full_messages,
      details: exp.result.reasons.details
    }
  )
end
```

## Scoping Data

You can add `authorized_scope: true` option to a field (list or [_connection_](https://graphql-ruby.org/relay/connections.html)) to apply the corresponding policy rules to the data:

```ruby
class CityType < ::Common::Graphql::Type
  # It would automatically apply the relation scope from the EventPolicy to
  # the relation (city.events)
  field :events, EventType.connection_type,
    null: false,
    authorized_scope: true

  # you can specify the policy explicitly
  field :events, EventType.connection_type,
    null: false,
    authorized_scope: {with: CustomEventPolicy}

  # without the option you would write the following code
  def events
    authorized_scope object.events
    # or if `with` option specified
    authorized_scope object.events, with: CustomEventPolicy
  end
end
```

**NOTE:** you cannot use `authorize: *` and `authorized_scope: *` at the same time but you can combine `preauthorize: *` with `authorized_scope: *`.

See the documenation on [scoping](./scoping.md).

## Exposing Authorization Rules

With `action_policy-graphql` gem, you can easily expose your authorization logic to the client in a standardized way.

For example, if you want to "tell" the client which actions could be performed against the object you
can use the `expose_authorization_rules` macro to add authorization-related fields to your type:

```ruby
class ProfileType < Types::BaseType
  # Adds can_edit, can_destroy fields with
  # AuthorizationResult type.

  # NOTE: prefix "can_" is used by default, no need to specify it explicitly
  expose_authorization_rules :edit?, :destroy?, prefix: "can_"
end
```

**NOTE:** you can use [aliases](./aliases.md) here as well as defined rules.

 **NOTE:** This feature relies the [_failure reasons_](./reasons.md) and
the [i18n integration](./i18n.md) extensions. If your policies don't include any of these,
you won't be able to use it.

Then the client could perform the following query:

```gql
{
  post(id: $id) {
    canEdit {
      # (bool) true|false; not null
      value
      # top-level decline message ("Not authorized" by default); null if value is true
      message
      # detailed information about the decline reasons; null if value is true or you don't have "failure reasons" extension enabled
      reasons {
        details # JSON-encoded hash of the form { "event" => [:privacy_off?] }
        fullMessages # Array of human-readable reasons
      }
    }

    canDestroy {
      # ...
    }
  }
}
```

You can override a custom authorization field prefix (`can_`):

```ruby
ActionPolicy::GraphQL.default_authorization_field_prefix = "allowed_to_"
```

You can specify a custom field name as well (only for a single rule):

```ruby
class ProfileType < ::Common::Graphql::Type
  # Adds can_create_post field.

  expose_authorization_rules :create?, with: PostPolicy, field_name: "can_create_post"
end
```

## Custom Behaviour

Including the default `ActionPolicy::GraphQL::Behaviour` is equal to adding the following to your base class:

```ruby
class Types::BaseObject < GraphQL::Schema::Object
  # include Action Policy behaviour and its extensions
  include ActionPolicy::Behaviour
  include ActionPolicy::Behaviours::ThreadMemoized
  include ActionPolicy::Behaviours::Memoized
  include ActionPolicy::Behaviours::Namespaced

  # define authorization context
  authorize :user, through: :current_user

  # add a method helper to get the current_user from the context
  def current_user
    context[:current_user]
  end

  # extend the field class to add `authorize` and `authorized_scope` options
  field_class.prepend(ActionPolicy::GraphQL::AuthorizedField)

  # add `expose_authorization_rules` macro
  include ActionPolicy::GraphQL::Fields
end
```

Feel free to create your own behaviour by adding only the functionality you need.
