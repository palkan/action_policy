# I18n Support

`ActionPolicy` integrates with [`i18n`][] to support localizable `full_messages` for [reasons](./reasons.md) and the execution result's `message`:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  rescue_from ActionPolicy::Unauthorized do |ex|
    p ex.result.message #=> "You do not have access to the stage"
    p ex.result.reasons.full_messages #=> ["You do not have access to the stage"]
  end
end
```

The message contains a string for the _rule_ that was called, while `full_messages` contains the list of reasons, why `ActionPolicy::Unauthorized` has been raised. You can find more information about tracking failure reasons [here](./reasons.md).

## Configuration

`ActionPolicy` doesn't provide any localization out-of-the-box and uses "You are not authorized to perform this action" as the default message.

You can add your app-level default fallback by providing the `action_policy.unauthorized` key value.

When using **Rails**, all you need is to add translations to any file under the `config/locales` folder (or create a new file, e.g. `config/locales/policies.yml`).

Non-Rails projets should configure [`i18n`][] gem manually:

```ruby
I18n.load_path << Dir[File.expand_path("config/locales") + "/*.yml"]
```

## Translations lookup

`ActionPolicy` uses the `action_policy` scope. Specific policies translations must be stored inside the `policy` sub-scope.

The following algorithm is used to find out the translation for a policy with a class `klass` and rule `rule`:

1. Translation for `"#{klass.identifier}.#{rule}"` key, when `self.identifier =` is not specified then underscored class name without the _Policy_ suffix would be used (e.g. `GuestUserPolicy` turns into `guest_user:` scope)
2. Repeat step 1 for each ancestor which looks like a policy (`.respond_to?(:identifier)?`) up to `ActionPolicy::Base`
3. Use `#{rule}` key
4. Use `en.action_policy.unauthorized` key
5. Use a default message provided by the gem

For example, given a `GuestUserPolicy` class which is inherited from `DefaultUserPolicy` and a rule `feed?`, the following list of possible translation keys would be used: `[:"action_policy.policy.guest_user.feed?", :"action_policy.policy.default_user.feed?", :"action_policy.policy.feed?", :"action_policy.unauthorized"]`
